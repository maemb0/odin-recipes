    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start preparing ragù by sautéeing pancetta in a large stockpot over
        medium-high heat until fat renders, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery,
        onion, and oil. Cook, stirring until vegetables have softened, about 5
        minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook while mashing meat into small pieces
        until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add wine and bring to a boil. Add 1 cup broth and tomato sauce. Reduce
        heat to low, and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape.
        Simmer ragù, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 more cup of broth to ragù. Continue simmering, stirring often,
        until very thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if necessary;
        ragù should drop, not run, off a spoon. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start preparing pasta after ragù is cooked. Bring water and salt to a
        boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach, cover, and return to a boil.
        Cook, stirring gently, until spinach is heated through. Remove from
        heat, leave covered, and let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with
        a fork to squeeze out as much water as possible; reserve the liquid.
        Purée spinach in a blender until smooth
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift flour into a bowl. Make a well in the center. Add eggs, spinach,
        and about 1 tablespoon of the reserved spinach cooking liquid. Mix
        together by hand or using the dough hook in a stand mixer, adding more
        liquid if needed, until dough becomes a smooth ball. Cover with plastic
        wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the ragù and season with salt. Remove from heat, add milk, and
        stir to combine. Set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide pasta dough into 4 equal pieces. Use a pasta machine or rolling
        pin dusted with flour to roll pasta into 1/16-inch thick sheets. Lay
        sheets on clean dish towels to help them dry. Let rest for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, start béchamel sauce by melting butter in a saucepan over
        medium heat. Do not allow to brown or burn. Add flour and whisk
        constantly until golden. Add 1/2 cup milk, whisking constantly. Repeat
        with remaining milk. Simmer until béchamel is thick, about 10 minutes.
        Season with nutmeg and salt.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Spread a bit of the ragù on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add a
        layer of pasta. Top with a spoonful of ragù and béchamel. Add a spoonful
        of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Top with another layer of pasta. Add more ragù,
        béchamel, and cheese. Repeat layers, finishing with a layer of pasta,
        béchamel, and cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the ragù is bubbling and the cheese has
        browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let lasagne rest for 10 or 15 minutes at room
        temperature before slicing.
      </li>
